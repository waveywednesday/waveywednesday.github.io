        <h1>HTML Validation Exercise</h1>
        <p>On this page there are a total of <strong>10 HTML errors</strong> that will cause the validation to not pass. Your job is to INDIVIDUALLY find each of the errors and correct them. After you are done correcting them, you will post your page to your personal github page (create a gh-pages branch first) and then send me the link to it. The format of your link will end up being username.github.io/file.html where username is replaced by your username and file is replaced by the name of your file.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a personal repository in the format of "username.github.io" if you haven't done so already</li>

        <p>
            The tiger <em>(Panthera tigris)</em> is the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae" target="_blank">cat species</a>, reaching a total body length of up to 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and exceptionally weighing up to 388.7 kg (857 lb) in the wild. Its most recognisable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.

        <p><strong>Fun Tiger Facts</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world. Adults can weigh up to 363kg - that's about the same as ten ten year olds! - and measure up to 3.3m!</li>
            <li>When a tiger wants to be heard, you'll know about it - their roar can be heard as far as three kilometres away.</li>
            <li>These fierce felines have walked the earth for a long time. Fossil remains of tigers found in parts of China are believed to be 2 million years old. Yikes!</li>
            <li>Every tiger in the world is unique - no two tigers have the same pattern of stripes</li>
            <li>
                Today, there are a few subspecies of tiger:
