	<p>Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid catarrhine primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.</p>

			<tr>
				<td>"Ape", from Old English apa, is a word of uncertain origin</td>
				<td>The term has a history of rather imprecise usage—and of comedic or punning usage in the vernacular</td>
				<td>Its earliest meaning was generally of any non-human anthropoid primate, as is still the case for its cognates in other Germanic languages.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Later, after the term "monkey" had been introduced into English, "ape" was specialized to refer to a tailless (therefore exceptionally human-like) primate</td>
				<td>Two tailless species of macaque still have common names using "ape": the Barbary ape of North Africa (introduced into Gibraltar), Macaca sylvanus, and the Sulawesi black ape or Celebes crested macaque, M. nigra.</td>
				<td>Thus, the term "ape" obtained two different meanings, as shown in the 1910 Encyclopædia Britannica entry: it could be used as a synonym for "monkey" and it could denote the tailless humanlike primate in particular.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>The primates called "apes" today became known to Europeans after the 18th century.</td>
				<td>As zoological knowledge developed, it became clear that taillessness occurred in a number of different and otherwise distantly related species.</td>
				<td>Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of those primatologists who developed the idea that there were trends in primate evolution and that the extant members of the order could be arranged in an ".. ascending series", leading from "monkeys" to "apes" to humans.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Within this tradition "ape" came to refer to all members of the superfamily Hominoidea except humans.</td>
				<td>As such, this use of "apes" represented a paraphyletic grouping, meaning that even though all species of apes were descended from a common ancestor this grouping did not include all the descendant species, because humans were excluded from being among the apes.</td>
				<td>The cladogram of superfamily Hominoidae shows the descendant relationships of the hominoids that are broadly accepted today</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Thus, there are (at least) three common, or traditional, uses of the term "ape": non-biologists may not distinguish between "monkeys" and "apes", that is, they may use the two terms interchangeably; or they may use "ape" for any tailless monkey or non-human hominoid; whereas biologists have traditionally used the term "ape" to mean the non-human hominoids only, as above.</td>
				<td>In recent years, when delineating classifications, biologists have generally preferred to use monophyletic groups only;[18] that is, they use only those groups that include all the descendants of a common ancestor.</td>
				<td>The superfamily Hominoidea is such a group—also known as a clade. </td>
