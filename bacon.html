            Information About Bacon</h2>
                <p class="bacon-info">It seems there has been a bacon explosion in America, in more ways than one. Bacon recipes are sweeping the blogoshere (like the famously fatty <a href="http://blog.bbqaddicts.com/recipes/bacon-explosion/"> Bacon Explosion</a> appetizer recipe). Fast-food chains are peddling double bacon burgers, and upscale restaurants are wrapping steaks in bacon -- even adding it to chic desserts. That’s right; chocolatiers are sprinkling bacon bits in chocolate bars like they are almonds. It’s the old sweet and savory marriage of flavors that seems to work so well.</p>
                <p><em>Although there's no arguing that bacon is a tasty treat, what about all that fat, sodium, and cholesterol? Is there any way for bacon to be part of a healthy diet?</em></p>

                <p class="bacon-answer">Thankfully, the answer is <strong>YES!</strong> Although bacon has many nurtitional deficiences, it can be part of a healthy diet. This way to do this is through moderation. About one ounce of bacon is enough every so often to avoid negative health effects. However, it should be known that bacon is in the group of meats that are processed and have been shown to increase the risk of cancer.</p>
