                <h2>New York Mets (WOOT!)</h2>
                <p>The New York Mets are back in the playoffs for the first time in nine years, which means the team has a chance to once again lose in some absolutely heartbreaking fashion! Better yet, that heartbreak has the potential to send the team's fan base into a collective downward spiral, the likes of which haven't been seen since, well, since the Mets last lost in the playoffs. </p>

                <p>You see, when the Mets lose in the playoffs, they don't just lose. They <strong><span class="u"><em>LOSE</em></span></strong>. So in honor of the unforgettably bad plays that almost certainly await the Mets in the 2015 postseason, here are the five most unforgettably bad plays from postseasons past. Go Mets!</p>

                <h2>Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>
                <p>The Friday opener against the Mets in the National League Division Series has been scheduled to begin at 6:45 p.m., while Saturday’s Game 2 has a 6:07 p.m. starting time. The two games are expected to feature outstanding starting pitching, but at least hitters shouldn't have to battle those 5 p.m. shadows at the stadium.</p>
                <p>The Dodgers have not officially announced their starting pitchers for the first two games in Los Angeles, though they are presumed to be Clayton Kershaw (16-7, 2.13 ERA) and Zack Greinke (19-3, 1.66). The Mets said they will start Jacob deGrom (14-8, 2.60) in the opener and Noah Syndergaard (9-7, 3.24) in Game 2.</p>

            <div class="cubs">
                <h2>Chicago Cubs</h2>
                <p>For followers of the Chicago Cubs, this has been a season of wonders. Thirteen walk-off wins! A run of 21 victories in 25 games! The ace pitcher ends a team losing streak by throwing a no-hitter! On Wednesday, the Cubs play the Pittsburgh Pirates in a one game, wild-card playoff to see who advances to the division series, and oddsmakers are giving the Cubs a slight edge. If the Cubs do advance, they will be seeking their first World Series title since Henry Ford was rolling his first Model T ($850) off the assembly line. Meantime, it seems as if all of Chicago is already planning the explosive celebration.</p>

            <div class="pittsburgh">
                <h2>Pittsburgh Pirates</h2>
                <p>The Pittsburgh Pirates just won 98 games. It’s the most games they’ve won in a season since 1991.They finished 2015 with the second best record in baseball. That’s a regular season the Pirates should be proud of. Yet, Wednesday night they will face one of the best pitchers in baseball in a winner-take-all Wild Card game. Oh yeah, the team they’re facing also has the third best record in baseball.</p>
                <p>On the surface this doesn’t really seem fair. However, under the current playoff format this is the reality the Pirates face. Without question they have a hard road ahead of them, but what are the chances that they could win their first world championship since 1979? Could this finally be the year that the World Series trophy comes back to Pittsburgh?</p>

            <div class="cardinals">
                <h2>St. Louis Cardinals</h2>
                <p>The Cardinals have been impressive enough with an 11-8 record in World Series and 7-6 league championship series mark. But where they really have excelled in postseason baseball is in the division series round.</p>
                <p>Since that round came into play in the three-tiered, and now four-tiered, playoff format, the Cardinals are 10-2 in division series — losing only three games to two to Arizona in 2001 and 3-0 to Los Angeles in 2009.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, as the Cardinals prepare to play either Chicago or Pittsburgh here in a National League Division Series beginning Friday, the Cardinals have a 30-9 advantage in division series games, having swept San Diego twice and Atlanta and Arizona once apiece.</p>
